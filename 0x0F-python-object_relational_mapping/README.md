1. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
Definition: ORM is a programming technique that allows interaction between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language. It maps the data from the database to objects in the programming language, making it easier to work with databases using the programming language's syntax.
Purpose: ORM simplifies database interactions, reduces the need for raw SQL queries, and enables developers to work with databases in a more intuitive, object-oriented manner.
2. Python and ORM:
Popular ORM Libraries: In Python, there are several popular ORM libraries/frameworks, including SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee.
Usage: These libraries provide tools and abstractions to map Python objects to database tables, define relationships, and perform database operations using Python code.
