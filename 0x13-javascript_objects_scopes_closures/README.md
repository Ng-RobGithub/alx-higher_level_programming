JavaScript Objects:

JavaScript objects are complex data types that allow you to store and organize data using key-value pairs.

Scopes:

Scope in JavaScript refers to the context in which variables are declared and accessed.
JavaScript has function scope, which means variables defined inside a function are local to that function.
The introduction of let and const in ES6 brought block-scoping to JavaScript.

Closures:

A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
Closures allow you to create private variables and functions in JavaScript.
